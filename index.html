            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p>
            <p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <code>x = 1;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
            <code>x = 3;</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code</p>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            <code>x = 4;</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p>
            <code>x = 5;</code>
